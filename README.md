## Vacation Scheduler

### Summary
	Schedules a vacation plan for the user based on where they want to go, the vicinity they are in, and the priority they set the tasks in. Made for HackUCI 2018.

	This calendar takes input from the user of what city they are visiting, their sleeping schedule, and when they are staying in said city.
	It will then ask the user for places they would like to go. The calendar searches which places are closest in proximity and creates a schedule based on that.
