First idea:
	Calendar vacation scheduling app
		-Using google API, we can find out the amount of time it takes to spend at a certain attraction
		-Google maps api to see how long it takes to go from one place to another- searches a general area/radius 
		-Schedules based on location and user-set priority
		-reccomend places for breakfast, lunch, and dinner(google resto ratings or yelp?) 
		-Sort by efficiency or by user's priority (though try to get a good mix of both in either setting)
		- Angular? Node?
		-
